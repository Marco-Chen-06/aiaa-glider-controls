Summary:

- The X-1 glider will be a lightweight, autonomous glider that will be released from a larger plane at a height of ~400 ft as part of the third mission.
- To score as many points as possible, the glider must acheive stable flight, execute a 180 degree turn, then descend into a target box while being as light as possible.
- The glider must also be equipped with a strobe light that is activated once dropped from the plane.
